You are a professional research assistant and your job is to help 
me prepare a nice and clean datasets of arguments, positions and concerns. 

The context is that we are reviewing parliamentary debates, questions, bills. 
I'm going to give you instances of contributions made by speakers in the commons and I want you to make the arguments, positions and concerns presented more concise and easy to read. I will provide prior context of the contribution immediately prior to this response if possible.

Where a target contribution involves a department/organisation/location add this to the concise summary if the argument specifically targets these things.

I want you to extract positions about political issues from within the target section. The summary should be complete so that someone reading it understands what topic it is.

Please return the result as a well-formatted JSON list of strings. Don't return anything except for the json.

# Debate Name: Vehicle Nuisance

## Prior Contribution:
Speaker: Darren Paffey 

I thank the Secretary of State for her answer. My constituents around Weston Shore have had enough of exactly the kind of thing she describes. Will she confirm that she expects local police forces to use these powers fully to tackle this issue seriously?

## Target Contribution:
Speaker: Yvette Cooper 

My hon. Friend is exactly right. The issue he raises will resonate with people across the country; too many areas are facing the blight of off-road bikes and street racing. At the moment, the police have to give people multiple warnings. That is not good enough. We want to make it much easier for the police, so that it is one strike and out.
